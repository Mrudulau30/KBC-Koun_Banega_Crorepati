Here is the another mini project I have created in python.

## Features of the Game:

1. This game has total 15 rounds.
2. In each round, user will get a question.
3. For each question, there are 4 choices out of which ONLY one is correct.
4. Each correct answer get the user money corresponding to the question and displays the next question.
5. If the user is:
       1. below questions number 5, then the minimum amount rewarded is Rs. 0 (zero)
       2. As he correctly answers question number 5, the minimum reward becomes Rs. 10,000 (First level)
       3. As he correctly answers question number 11, the minimum reward becomes Rs. 3,20,000 (Second Level)
6. If the answer is wrong, then the user will return with the minimum reward.
7. If the user inputs "lifeline" (case insensitive) as input, then hide two incorrect options and prompt again for the input of answer.
8. 50-50 lifeline can be used ONLY ONCE.There is no option of lifeline for the last question( ques no. 15 ), even if the user has not used it before.
9. If the user inputs "quit" (case insensitive) as input, then user returns with the amount he has won until now, instead of the minimum amount.
